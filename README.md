# TicTacTOEGam


Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a very popular game played by two participants on the grid of 3 by 3. A special symbol (X or O) is assigned to each 
participant to indicate that the slot is covered by the respective participant. The winner of the game is the participant who first cover a horizontal,
vertical or diagonal row of the board having only their symbols.

The game I developed is a simple tic tac toe game some of the snap i'm attesting with the documents.
